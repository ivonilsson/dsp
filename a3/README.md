# Tasks
Look at the tasks to make sure everything is done as described.

## Exercise 2: Visualization with Seaborn for Exploratory Data Analysis

### Data Cleaning
- [ ] Count NaN values in each column
- [ ] Drop all rows containing NaN values
- [ ] Find unique values for `something` and `something`, and min/max/mean for numeric columns

### Plotting Data Distributions
- [ ] Produce a histogram of something (Pandas API)
- [ ] Produce a histogram of something else (Seaborn API)
- [ ] Produce a histogram of something conditioned on something else (hue)
- [ ] Try different variables for histograms (e.g., something, something else)
- [ ] Turn a histogram into a KDE plot

### Plotting Relationships Between Variables
- [ ] Scatter plot: something vs. something
- [ ] Scatter plot: something vs. something, colored by something
- [ ] Linear regression: something vs. something else (simple)
- [ ] Linear regression: something vs. something else, conditioned on something
- [ ] Facet grid: scatter plot by something

### Plotting Categorical Data
- [x] Categorical scatter plot: something vs. something else
- [x] Box plot: something vs. something else
- [x] Bar plot (count plot): something count by something and something else

### Plotting Time Series Data
- [x] Line plot: something vs. something else
- [x] Line plot: something vs. something else, something else 2, and something else 3 (wide-form data)

## Exercise 3: Making High-Quality Seaborn Visualizations

### Controlling Figure Aesthetics (Line Plot)
- [ ] Change plot style: white background, ticks, remove top/right spines
- [ ] Make plot larger, increase font and line thickness, adjust legend
- [ ] Set y-axis major ticks every 50, minor ticks every 10
- [ ] Turn off error band plotting
- [ ] Add markers for data points, make all lines solid

### Categorical Plots & Facet Grids (Yu-Gi-Oh Dataset)
- [ ] Scatter plot: some variable vs. some other variable, colored by "level" or value levels, use `flare` palette
- [ ] Set minor ticks every 100 on axes, change axis labels, show all 8 levels in legend, move legend outside plot
- [ ] FacetGrid: scatter plot by Attributes, custom column titles
- [ ] Assign individual colors to monster Attributes in strip plot
